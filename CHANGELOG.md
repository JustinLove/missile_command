## 0.3.0

- bugfix: Showing jump icon on created events.
- Prefer location over jump to group so hover works with a selection.

## 0.2.0

- More conservative with hover pips to avoid loosing user selection.
- The mod should remember launcher state.  Launchers will be remembered over refresh and changing scenes, such as settings.
- Window is invisible until a nuke launcher is registered.
